    "full_text": "Anyone who has lost their permanent accommodation is classified in the UK as homeless. Sometimes these may be people who have nowhere to live and are literally sleeping on the street. In practice, the majority will be people living in temporary accommodation. All of the bodies concerned with the homeless agree with the government on exact numbers of homeless people, mainly because each organization has its own way of defining who the homeless are. Leaving this question aside, most agree about the causes of homelessness. Many people who previously lived at home with their families, or who were living above the shop where they work, may find themselves without a roof over their heads when they can no longer be helped. The same way, some people in this category, sometimes known as 'sofa surfers', end up going from one house to another, and may not appear in the statistics at all. Another large group comes under the heading of 'relationship breakdown'. When this event breaks up, either or both parties may find themselves with nowhere to go. Others who may be living, for example, in a flat above the shop where they work, may find themselves without a home when they are out of work. Finally, there is a small group who have got into financial difficulties, and cannot pay the rent or the mortgage on their property.",
